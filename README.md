## Setup Path

## Base game gproj

From Linux:

`/home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Arma Reforger/addons/data/ArmaReforger.gproj`

Translates to in winslows:

`Z:\home\$USER.local\share\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma Reforger\addons\data\ArmaReforger.gproj`

## Addons gproj 

APPID = 1874880

`~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/[APPID]/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/ArmaReforger/addons`

Not confusing at all.
