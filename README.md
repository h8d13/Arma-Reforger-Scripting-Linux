## Setup Path

## Base game gproj

From Linux:

Add existing >

`/home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Arma Reforger/addons/data/ArmaReforger.gproj`

Translates to in winslows:

`Z:\home\$USER\.local\share\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma Reforger\addons\data\ArmaReforger.gproj`

## Addons gproj 

APPID = 1874880

Add existing or scan >

`~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/[APPID]/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/ArmaReforger/addons`

Not confusing at all.

Now you are good to go.

Right click the main game > Open with addon **and boom.**

Then when you are done exploring and want to create: Go back to that screen there by closing and opening tools... 
> I couldn't find a button to go back to project window...

Then create new project and select deps.

Note path here we'll have to translate again `C:/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/ArmaReforgerWorkbench/addons`
